    "The decrease in cost and increase in throughput of sequencing technologies has allowed the sequencing of multiple organisms in the recent years. De novo genome assembly consists in joining the sequencing reads together to assemble the original genome. You can think of this as solving a puzzle. The fundamental feature behind genome assembly is finding the overlaps between the reads. The way to represent these overlaps is using graphs. \n",
    "There are many advantages of having an assembled genome instead of the sequencing reads (even when mapped). The most obvious is the  sequencing of new species for which there is no reference genome available. But also, to find new regions that are not present in a reference genome, investigate the structural variation or find new genes. In this assignment, you will use both short read (Illumina) and long read (Oxford Nanopore) sequencing data to assemble some part of the human genome. Since assembling an entire human genome or even one chromosome would take too much computational time and memory we will limit ourselves to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci.  \n",
    "Before starting a quick reminder of some terms that are essential to genome assembly:\n",
    " - **Read:** Any sequence that comes out of the sequencer. Short reads are between 100-300 base pairs (bp) and long reads are > 1000 bp, reaching even hundreds of thousands of base pairs. \n",
    " - **Coverage:** Sequencing depth; Average number of reads per base in the genome. \n",
    " - **_k_-mer:** Sub-sequence of length _k_.\n",
    " - **Contig:** Assembled sequence without any gaps. \n",
    " - **N50:** Size of the contig which, together with all larger contigs, amounts for over 50% of the total assembly. Gives an idea about the contiguity of an assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A) Assembling short reads: De Bruijn graphs <a name=\"De Bruijn graphs\"></a>\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "To build a De Bruijn graph (DBG), the set of reads is divided into _k-mers_ (sub-sequences of length _k_). For example for a read of length 12 there are 4 possible k-mers of _k_ = 9:\n",

    "The nodes of a DBG represent these k-mers and the edges between the nodes represent the overlaps between them. These overlaps are exact and have a length _k_ - 1. Once the DBG is formed, it can be traversed using an _Eulerian_ path, which means that all edges need to be traversed once. In the following figure a 3-mer DBG is formed from reads of length 4.\n",

It uses a two-step approach: 1) _velveth_ \"hashes\" the reads, i.e. indexes them to find which _k_-mers occur in which reads; 2) _velvetg_ creates a DBG, simplifies it (removes errors) and extracts the contigs.\n",

    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "In the latest years new sequencing technologies allow to sequence longer fragments of DNA, generating reads of tens and even hundreds of kilo base pairs (Kbp). However, the per base error rate is higher that with Illumina short read sequencing. As mentioned above, De Bruijn graphs are very sensitive to sequencing errors, therefore they are not applicable with this type of data. Nonetheless, the increased read length allows to span repeats and find longer unique overlaps. There a more straightfoward algorithm can be used. Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) works in three steps:\n",
    "1. **Overlap:**Find the overlapping reads. This is a computationally expensive step, given the large number of pairwise comparisons needed. The overlap graph is then constructed. In this case, nodes directly represent the reads and edges represent the overlaps between them (with no fixed length). \n",
    "+ **Layout**: First simplify the graph. Reads (nodes) that are completely contained in other reads are removed. Redundant edges are also remove using _transitive reduction_:If a > c and a > b > c, then remove a > c. Finally, the simplified graph is traversed using a _Hamiltonian_ path, where all nodes need to be visited once. Contigs are formed in this step.\n",
    "+ **Consensus:** Find the most likely nucleotide for each position of each contig using multiple sequence alignment. \n",
